A Smart Controller for the AR-22 Rotator by WA2FZW
Version 05.2

The AR-22 rotator controller is an Arduino Uno based controller for the old
CDE AR-22 antenna rotator which replaces the clunk-clunk controller that the
original used.

The main features include the ability to turn the antenna in 1, 5 or 10
degree increments and the ability to control it with many of the rotator
control programs available such as the N1MM Rotor program.

The files provided here include the latest version of the software, a manual
describing how to build and use the controller and the Gerber files needed
to fabricate the 2 custom PCBs used.
